# oh-yes
a pretty much useless discord bot

# how 2 config
rename the file called config-template.json to config.json, put it in the folder where the bot folder is and change what you want

# how 2 test
do you want to see the bot in action but don't want to download anything? join  [our discord server](discord.gg/VgwTUjx)
